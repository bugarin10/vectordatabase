### Guide to Understanding the Code for Creating a Vectordatabase

I'll walk you through the code step by step to explain what a vectordatabase is and how it's being created using Python and various libraries.

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:**
   ```python
   import langchain
   import pandas
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
   from utils import *
   from langchain.text_splitter import TokenTextSplitter
   import chromadb
   import ollama
   ```

   Here, we import libraries such as langchain, pandas, SentenceTransformer, utils, langchain.text_splitter, chromadb, and ollama. These libraries are used for text processing, embedding sentences, managing databases, and conducting language-based tasks.

2. **Reading and Preprocessing Text Data:**
   ```python
   with open("resume.txt", "r") as file:
       text_to_split = file.read()
   text_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(encoding_name="gpt2", chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=10)
   texts = text_splitter.split_text(text_to_split)
   texts = list(map(lambda x: x.replace("\n", " "), texts))
   ```

   This section reads text data from a file ("resume.txt"), splits it into chunks using TokenTextSplitter, and preprocesses it by removing newline characters.

3. **Generating Text Embeddings:**
   ```python
   model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
   embedding_list = model.encode(texts)
   ```

   Using SentenceTransformer, we encode the preprocessed text chunks into embeddings. These embeddings represent the semantic meaning of each text chunk.

4. **Working with ChromaDB:**
   ```python
   chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
   collection_name = "mycollection"
   collections = chroma_client.list_collections()
   collection_names = [collection.name for collection in collections]
   ```

   We initialize a ChromaDB client and interact with a collection named "mycollection" within the database. We also retrieve existing collection names to check if "mycollection" already exists.

5. **Creating or Loading Collection in ChromaDB:**
   ```python
   if collection_name in collection_names:
       collection = chroma_client.get_collection(collection_name)
       print("Loaded existing collection:", collection_name)
   else:
       collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name=collection_name)
       print("Created new collection:", collection_name)
   ```

   Depending on whether "mycollection" exists, we either load the existing collection or create a new one.

6. **Adding Data to Collection:**
   ```python
   collection.add(
       embeddings=embedding_list,
       documents=texts,
       ids=["ID" + str(i) for i in range(len(embedding_list))],
   )
   ```

   We add the text embeddings, corresponding documents, and unique IDs to the collection in ChromaDB. This step populates the vectordatabase with our encoded text data.

7. **Querying the Collection:**
   ```python
   question = "Tell me about Rafael Davila"
   similar_documents = collection.query(query_texts=[question], n_results=3)
   ```

   We query the collection to find similar documents based on a given query text ("Tell me about sodemca") and retrieve the top 3 most similar documents.

8. **Using Ollama for Language-Based Tasks:**
   ```python
   content = f"Answer the following question:{question}\
       With this context:{context}.\
       Do not provide answers outside this context."

   response = ollama.chat(
       model="llama2",
       messages=[
           {"role": "user", "content": content},
       ],
   )
   print(response["message"]["content"])
   ```

   Finally, we use Ollama to engage in a conversation based on a given question within a specific context. The response contains the answer provided by the model within the defined context.

   This is the output:

   ```bash
   Rafael Davila Bugarín is a highly motivated and accomplished individual with a passion for mathematics and education. As a Fulbright-García Robles scholar, he will be pursuing his second master's degree in Data Science at Duke University in North Carolina. Rafael has also worked as a Research Assistant at the Duke Center for Research & Engineering of AI Technology in Education and as a Digital Transformation Officer at the Federal Telecommunications Institute Benito Juarez in Mexico City.

Rafael values the role of mathematics in his career and is dedicated to inspiring young minds through mathematics clubs for children. He is also skilled in various technical skills, including Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PySpark, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, git, emacs, docker, AWS, and Azure. Additionally, he has experience in leading data engineering processes and developing AI-based software tools to enhance teaching and learning.

SODEMCA, a summer course program that Rafael is involved with, encourages critical thinking through playful activities, strategy games, logic games, and a pre-algebra showcase. The program also provides expert guidance for children facing challenges in learning mathematics.

Rafael's theory of change aims to contribute to children's education in Mexico by teaching 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and creativity and innovation. To achieve this, SODEMCA creates mathematics clubs where members can nurture their love for mathematics, build a community, incorporate innovative educational materials, train teachers, and provide evidence-based support to parents.

The consequences of learning mathematics according to Rafael include improved mental abilities, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking. He believes that these skills are essential for children's intellectual growth and development.

This code essentially demonstrates the process of creating and utilizing a vectordatabase to store and retrieve text data efficiently for language-related tasks.
